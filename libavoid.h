//! <h2>libavoid Information</h2>
//!
//! libavoid is a cross-platform C++ library providing fast, object-avoiding 
//! orthogonal and polyline connector routing for use in interactive diagram 
//! editors.
//!
//! libavoid is part of the 
//! <a href="http://adaptagrams.sourceforge.net/">Adaptagrams project</a>. 
//! There are no official releases yet, though the code is stable and 
//! available from the Adaptagrams 
//! <a href="http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=154331">SVN 
//! repository</a>. 
//!
//! libavoid is written and maintained by Michael Wybrow, a member of the 
//! Adaptive Diagrams and Documents lab at Monash University, Australia.
//!
//! The algorithms used for the connector routing are described in:
//! -  M. Wybrow, K. Marriott, and P.J. Stuckey. Orthogonal connector 
//!    routing.<br />
//!    In Proceedings of 17th International Symposium on Graph Drawing 
//!    (GD '09),<br /> 
//!    To appear 2010.
