libavoid - Fast, Incremental, Object-avoiding Line Router
Copyright (C) 2004-2007  Michael Wybrow <mjwybrow@users.sourceforge.net>

A cross-platform C++ library providing fast, object-avoiding connector
routing for use in interactive diagram editors.


This is an alpha release.  There is currently no documentation due to the
fact that orthogonal connectors are being worked on as well as other features
such as connector crossing avoidance.  Once these features are present, 
documentation will be added for the interface.  At the same time, the build
system will be cleaned up to use the configure/automake tools, and the first
"offical" release of libavoid will be made.

libavoid is currently used in the prototype research diagram editor "Dunnart":

As well as the professional open-source vector graphics editor "Inkscape":

The algorithms used for the connector routing are described in:
