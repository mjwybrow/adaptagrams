libavoid - Fast, Incremental, Object-avoiding Line Router

Copyright (C) 2004-2009  Monash University

A cross-platform C++ library providing fast, object-avoiding connector
routing for use in interactive diagram editors.

Documentation is available for libavoid through Doxygen.  Install Doxygen and
run it in the libavoid directory to generate documentation for the interface.

libavoid is written and maintained by Michael Wybrow, a member of the 
Adaptive Diagrams and Documents lab at Monash University, Australia.
