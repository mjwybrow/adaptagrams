A cross-platform C++ library providing fast, object-avoiding connector
routing for use in interactive diagram editors.

Documentation is available for libavoid through Doxygen.  Install Doxygen and
run it in the libavoid directory to generate documentation for the interface.

Orthogonal routing capabilities have been added.  These will be refined and
improved leading up to an official release of he library.

libavoid is currently used in the prototype research diagram editor "Dunnart":

As well as the professional open-source vector graphics editor "Inkscape":
  http://www.inkscape.org/

The algorithms used for the connector routing are described in:
