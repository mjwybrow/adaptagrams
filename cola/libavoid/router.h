{
    //! @brief  This penalty is applied for each segment in the connector 
    //!         path beyond the first.  This should always normally be set
    //!         when doing orthogonal routing to prevent step-like connector
    //!         paths.
    //! @note   This penalty must be set (i.e., be greater than zero) in

    //!         this requires reasonable initial routes.

    //!         bends in the connector path.  A smaller portion of the penalty
    //!         is applied for slight bends, i.e., where the bend is close to
    //!         180 degrees.  This is useful for polyline routing where there
    //!         is some evidence that tighter corners are worse for 
    //!         readability, but that slight bends might not be so bad, 
    //!         especially when smoothed by curves.
    anglePenalty,
    
    //! @brief  This penalty is applied whenever a connector path crosses 
    //!         another connector path.  It takes shared paths into 
    //!         consideration and the penalty is only applied if there
    //!         is an actual crossing.
    //! @note   This penalty is still experimental!  It is not recommended
    //!         for normal use.
    crossingPenalty,
    
    //! @brief  This penalty is applied whenever a connector path crosses 
    //!         a cluster boundary.
    //! @note   This penalty is still experimental!  It is not recommended
    //!         for normal use.
    //! @note   This penalty is very slow.  You can override the method
    //!         Router::shouldContinueTransactionWithProgress() to check
    //!         progress and possibly cancel overly slow transactions.
    clusterCrossingPenalty,
    
    //! @brief  This penalty is applied whenever a connector path shares 
    //!         some segments with an immovable portion of an existing 
    //!         connector route (such as the first or last segment of a
    //!         connector).
    //! @note   This penalty is still experimental!  It is not recommended
    //!         for normal use.
    fixedSharedPathPenalty,
    
    //! @brief  This penalty is applied to port selection choice when the 
    //!         other end of the connector being routed does not appear in 
    //!         any of the 90 degree visibility cones centered on the
    //!         visibility directions for the port.
    //! @note   This penalty is still experimental!  It is not recommended
    //!         for normal use.
    //! @note   This penalty is very slow.  You can override the method
    //!         Router::shouldContinueTransactionWithProgress() to check
    //!         progress and possibly cancel overly slow transactions.

    //! @brief This parameter defines the spacing distance that will be added
    //!        to the sides of each shape when determining obstacle sizes for
    //!        routing.  This controls how closely connectors pass shapes, and
    //!        can be used to prevent connectors overlapping with shape 
    //!        boundaries. By default, this distance is set to a value of 0.
    shapeBufferDistance,
    
    //! @brief This parameter defines the spacing distance that will be used
    //!        for nudging apart overlapping corners and line segments of

    //! @brief  This penalty is applied whenever a connector path travels
    //!         in the direction opposite of the destination from the source
    //!         endpoint.  By default this penalty is set to zero.  This 
    //!         shouldn't be needed in most cases but can be useful if you
    //!         use penalties such as crossingPenalty which cause connectors
    //!         to loop around obstacles.

    //!

    nudgeOrthogonalTouchingColinearSegments,
    
    //! This option can be used to control whether the router performs
    //! a preprocessing step before orthogonal nudging where is tries
    //! to unify segments and centre them in free space.  This 
    //! generally results in better quality ordering and nudging.
    //!         
    //! Defaults to true.

    //! You may wish to turn this off for large examples where it
    //! can be very slow and will make little difference.

    //! This option causes hyperedge routes to be locally improved fixing

    //!

    //! As part of this process libavoid will effectively move junctions by
    //! setting new ideal positions for each remaining or added junction, 
    //! which can be read from JunctionRef::recommendedPosition() for each

    improveHyperedgeRoutesMovingAddingAndDeletingJunctions,

        //! Note that you can get a sense of progress by looking at the

        //! proportions at which this method is called will vary, sometime
        //! unpredictably.
        //!
        //! You can return false to request that the Router abort the current

        //! you to interact with it again.  Hence you should wait for a final

        //! before continuing.
